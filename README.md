### Documentation sources

As mentioned above, the `docs` folder contains the source files for docs.

If you're adding a new doc or you need to alter the order the docs appear in the sidebar, take a look at the `sidebars.json` file in the `website` directory. The sidebar files contain a list of document ids that should match those defined in the header metadata (aka frontmatter) of the docs markdown files.

### Versioned docs

Docs of the website is versioned to allow users to go back and see the Guides for any given release. A new version of the website is generally generated whenever there is a new product release. When this happens, any changes made to the `docs` and `website/sidebars.json` files will be copied over to the corresponding location within `website/versioned_docs` and `website/versioned_sidebars`.

> **_Note:_** Do not edit the auto-generated files within `versioned_docs` or `versioned_sidebars` unless you are sure it is necessary. Edits made to older versions will not be propagated to newer versions of the versioned docs.

Docusaurus keeps track of the list of versions for the site in the `website/versions.json` file. The ordering of versions in this file should be in reverse chronological order.

#### Cutting a new version

1.  `cd docs-template` to go into the project root.
1.  `cd website` to go into the website portion of the project.
1.  Run `yarn version:cut <newVersion>` where `<newVersion>` is the new version being released.
