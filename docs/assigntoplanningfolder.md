A planning folder can contain artifacts from many different trackers. When you assign an artifact to a planning folder, the artifact is still in the tracker where it was created.

1. Click **Trackers** from the **Project Home** menu.
2. Find the tracker that contains the artifact you want to assign, and select the artifact. You can select any number of artifacts at once.
3. Click **Plan for** and select a planning folder.

The planning folder you assigned is now shown in the **Planned For** column on the **Planning Folder Summary** page.

You can always reassign an artifact to another planning folder as conditions change. Any effort data you have provided is recalculated automatically.

:::note
When a tracker is disabled, artifacts from that tracker do not contribute to the effort totals calculated for any planning folder they are in.

:::tip
When you are working with a single artifact, you might prefer another way to assign it to a planning folder which is to open the artifact you want to assign and look for the **Planning Folder** field. Select a planning folder for the artifact and save the artifact.
