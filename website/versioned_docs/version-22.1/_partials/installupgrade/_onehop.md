## One-hop Upgrade Compatibility

Though the TeamForge VAR::identifiers.teamforge installer supports one-hop upgrade from TeamForge VAR::identifiers.teamforge_onehop_compatible_version or later versions, TeamForge VAR::identifiers.teamforge upgrade instructions, in general, are for upgrading from TeamForge VAR::identifiers.teamforge_previous (including update releases, if any) to TeamForge VAR::identifiers.teamforge .
   
There is no support for one-hop upgrade from TeamForge VAR::identifiers.teamforge_onehop_incompatible_version or earlier to TeamForge VAR::identifiers.teamforge . You must upgrade your site to TeamForge VAR::identifiers.teamforge_onehop_compatible_version or later and then upgrade to TeamForge VAR::identifiers.teamforge .
