title: Remove a User from a Project
---


If your project is a subproject of any other project, your project may have inherited some users from the parent project. To remove an inherited user, you must go to the parent project where that user is a direct member.


 1. Click **PROJECT ADMIN** from the **Project Home** menu.

 2. On the **Project Admin Menu**, click **User Membership**. 

 3. From the list of current project members, select the user you want to remove and click **Remove**.
