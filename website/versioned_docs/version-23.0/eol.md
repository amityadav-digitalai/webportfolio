title: Digital.ai's Product End-of-Life Policy
---

Products reach the end of their life cycle for a number of reasons. These reasons may be due to market demands, technology innovation and development driving changes in the product, or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer technology. While this is an established part of the overall product life cycle, Digital.ai recognizes that end-of-life milestones often prompt companies to review the way in which such end-of-support and end-of-life milestones impact the Digital.ai products or its supported platforms. With that in mind, we have set out below Digital.ai's end-of-life policy to help customers better manage their end-of-life transition and to understand the role that Digital.ai can play in helping to migrate to alternative Digital.ai products, platforms and technologies. The general policy guidelines are:

* As a general rule, Digital.ai will provide six months' notice and we would send out regular notifications to all our customers through our Digital.ai blog, product notifications and/or support newsletter.
* We would End-Of-Life support for our products, platforms and software with our new version of our product release.
* We would continue to provide support to our products, platforms and software for our earlier supported product version.
* You will need to ensure that you have a current and fully paid support contract with Digital.ai to receive notifications on end of life. Please contact your Account Manager regarding fees payable during the end-of-life period so that we can support you right through the end-of-life transition period.
* See the list of [Currently Supported Products](https://www.collab.net/support/supported-products) for more information.
