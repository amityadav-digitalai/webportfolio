You can select the same planning folder in all three swimlanes. This enables an efficient and faster way of planning a sprint simultaneously for three different teams residing in the same planning folder. You can also select the same planning folder and same team in all three swimlanes for easy handling of artifact cards.

## View Artifact Cards

1. Click **TRACKERS** from the **Project Home** menu.

2. In the **List Trackers, Planning Folders and Teams** page, click **PLAN**. A Planning Board for the current project context is displayed.

3. Select a planning folder from the drop-down list.

  :::note
  You can select the same planning folder in all three swimlanes.

4. View the artifact cards based on your requirement:

   * Select a team from the **Select a Team** drop-down list to view artifacts of a specific team.

   * Select **None** to view unassigned artifacts.

   * Select **All artifacts** to view all the artifact cards residing in the selected planning folder.

   :::note
   If there are no teams created for a project, then the `Select a Team` drop-down list is not displayed at all.
   :::

## Assign Artifacts to a Team

You can select an unassigned artifact from one swimlane and drag it to another where you have a team selected.

  :::note
  Whenever you move an artifact card from one swimlane to another, all its child artifacts (if any) are also moved along with it
