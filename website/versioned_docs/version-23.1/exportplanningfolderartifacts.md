For example, sometimes it can be useful to look at the status of a project by sharing a spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets.

 1. Click **TRACKERS** from the **Project Home** menu.

 2. On the **List Trackers, Planning Folders and Teams** page, click **PLANNING FOLDER**.

 3. On the **Summary** page, click the desired planning folder.

 4. From the **List Artifacts** page, click **SORT** or **RANK** as required. You can also select specific set of artifacts to be exported.

    :::note
    When you export artifacts in the rank mode, the parent artifacts are listed along with the children as ranked in the **List Artifacts** page. Similarly, the sort order in the list view is retained in the exported list as well.

 5. Click **Export**.
